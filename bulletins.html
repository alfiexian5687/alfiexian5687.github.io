	<p>Our Parish Priest, Fr Mick Peters, is trying to development and foster a community for our 6 PM Vigil Mass at St Josephs on the Strand. 
I'm helping by organising an event format, where I invite our members to bring a plate for a buffet and I provide music, or friends who can sing or perform.</p>
<p>Now that we are achieving some success, we need more people who can sing or play music.</p> 
<p>I'm open to any kind of singing or performing so long as it is not too controversial. My preference would be for an artist to sing a medley of old time favorites.</p>
<p>Mass starts at 6pm and finishes about 10 to 7. </p>
    
    <p>If you would like to take part, please call <strong>Merle Trembath</strong> <a href="tel:0418882633">0418882633</a> anytime </p>
